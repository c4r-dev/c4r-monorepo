I'm conducting an analysis of a participant's approach in Wason's 2-4-6 task and require your expertise in evaluating their strategy. The participant was asked to guess sequences of three numbers and then propose a rule based on the feedback received. 
For each guess, I have collected specific data: the sequence of numbers they chose, whether those numbers fit the actual rule of the task (yes/no), the participant's stated hypothesis about the rule, and a percentage indicating their confidence level in that guess.

Please analyze the data provided and determine at each step whether the participant appears to be attempting to disprove their initial hypothesis or merely testing guesses without this intent. I request that your response be structured to reflect this evaluation for each guess, considering the progression in their guesses, the feedback received, and changes in their confidence levels.

Please respond with strictly true or false for you analysis of each. Format your answers in a json format. Example: 
[
    {
        "entryNumber": 0,
        "disproveAttempt": false
    },
    {
        "entryNumber": 1,
        "disproveAttempt": false
    },
    {
        "entryNumber": 2,
        "disproveAttempt": false
    }
]

No not respond with any additional textm just this formatted json response. Even if you cant come up with an answer.
