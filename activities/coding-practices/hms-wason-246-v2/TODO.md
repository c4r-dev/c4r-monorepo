TODO:

Current:

- Ensure sessionID is being sent to the API
- Use sessionID to query the database for the review data
- Add logic where sessionID = 0, means fetch data from all sessions


Next:
- Refactor buttons to use new component instead of html buttons
- See resizing of input number field
- See if I can do anything about those up/down buttons
- Maybe MUI has a nicer input form
- See if I can do anything about the "final guess" input form
- Refactor buttons everywhere


Next / Low Priority:
- Input Page:
    - Add a "back" button to the input page
