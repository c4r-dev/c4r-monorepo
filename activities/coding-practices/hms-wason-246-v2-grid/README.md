# Activity Description

This exercise is a reimagining of Wason's "2,4,6". The aim is for students to see bias in their own and other student's behavior. The exercise is a simplification of the testing of hypotheses that scientists do in their research, with each guess an "experiment" to find the "truth" - a simple number rule. Students will see that it is common to make guesses that confirm what they already think. Students will be presented with the results that will illustrate how much quicker and more likely they are to find the "truth" if they try and falsify their hypotheses. The exercise is the beginning of building an intuition around the risk of confirmation bias, and a motivation for learning the methods of mitigating bias that are introduced in the unit.

## Current Rule List

1. **Any three numbers in increasing order**
2. **Numbers increasing by 2**
3. **The first digit is 2**
4. **Total sum is divisible by 3**
5. **Last number is equal to the sum of the first two**
6. **Last number is greater than or equal to the sum of the first two**
7. **All numbers are even**
8. **At least one number is even**

## Setup

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
