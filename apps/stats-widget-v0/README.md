## **Background:** (Copied from notion docs)

Road to Rigor begins with a mini-unit called “The Extent of the Problem”. As the name suggests, this mini-unit introduces students to the extent of the rigor & reproducibility issue. One of the ways we try to achieve an emotional impact is by citing a Nature survey that produced pretty devastating results as to how widespread these problems are in different fields.

In order to make these stats a little more engaging than just another video, we’d like students to be able to guess the stats for both their particular field and science more broadly before they learn what the real statistics are.

### **User story**

As a presenting student, I want to see interactive charts that ask the following questions:

1. What percentage of researchers believe that there is a reproducibility crisis?
2. What percentage of researchers in my field have failed to reproduce someone else’s experiment?
3. What percentage of researchers in my field have failed to reproduce their own experiment?
4. What percentage of work in my field do relevant researchers think is reproducible?

For each of these, I want to be able to click and drag on the chart to make my guess. Once I lock in my guess, I want to see the real value in another chart next to mine. I would also like to see suggestions for lab discussion of the results for each stat.

At the end, I want to be given an audience prompt asking all non-presenting students the following question:

> Were you surprised by the difference between your guesses and the Baker findings? What do you suppose the results might suggest about your lab?
