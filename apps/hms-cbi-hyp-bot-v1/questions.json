  "Is there another plausible reason for the outcome other than your hypothesized cause? What is it? Can you design your study to test for this other cause?",
  "If your current hypothesis turns out to be incorrect, what might be another plausible explanation, and what evidence would support it?",
  "What factors could contribute to the observed effect, and how would you design experiments to test each factor?",
  "What are some hypotheses that directly contradict your initial assumptions, and why might they still be worth exploring?",
  "Goal: Prevent the student from favoring one hypothesis without sufficient justification.",
  "What specific evidence would disprove your hypothesis; could you design a study to collect that evidence?",
  "Which results or observations have you been inclined to dismiss or downplay, and why?",
  "How would you design an experiment that directly challenges your favored hypothesis rather than supports it?",
  "If someone with an opposite perspective reviewed your hypothesis, what kinds of criticisms or alternative explanations might they suggest, and how would you address them?",
  "Goal: Ensure the hypothesis is testable within the student\u2019s resources and timeframe.",
  "What tools, methods, and resources do you currently have to test this hypothesis, and what additional ones might you need?",
  "What specific technical or ethical limitations could you encounter when testing your hypothesis, and how might you address them?",
  "If parts of your hypothesis are untestable, what alternative approaches or adjustments could you make to ensure progress?",
  "Goal: Refine hypotheses to be clear, concise, and testable.",
  "What specific predictions does your hypothesis make, and how will you test these predictions?",
  "Are these predictions measurable? What methods will you use to ensure accurate measurement?",
  "What steps would someone else need to independently replicate your test for this hypothesis?",
  "How could you rephrase your hypothesis to remove any ambiguity and make it as clear and concise as possible?",
  "Goal: Highlight the importance of the null hypothesis in hypothesis testing.",
  "What is your null hypothesis, and how does it differ from your primary hypothesis in terms of predictions?",
  "What would it mean for your research and future experiments if the null hypothesis were true?",
  "How would you interpret results that seem to support the null hypothesis, and what follow-up experiments might you design?",
  "Goal: Relate the hypothesis to theory and existing knowledge.",
  "In what ways does your hypothesis align with, challenge, or expand existing theories in neuroscience?",
  "What prior studies or models provide support for your hypothesis, and what findings challenge it?",
  "If your hypothesis is supported, what broader implications might it have for the field of neuroscience or related areas?",
  "Goal: Challenge hypotheses derived directly from data without theoretical grounding.",
  "Was this hypothesis generated before you collected data, or was it shaped by patterns you observed in your results? How might that influence its validity?",
  "If this hypothesis was based on data patterns, how will you ensure it is not overly tailored or biased by those specific observations?",
  "What theory or mechanism underpins this hypothesis, and how does it guide your experimental approach?",
  "Goal: Broaden the scope of inquiry to consider multiple outcomes.",
  "Besides the outcome you expect, what other potential outcomes might arise from your experiment, and how would you interpret each one?",
  "What would each possible outcome suggest about your hypothesis, the null hypothesis, or alternative explanations?",
  "If the results are ambiguous or fall between supporting and rejecting your hypothesis, how would you approach interpreting and addressing them?",
  "Goal: Avoid premature commitment to a single idea.",
  "How has your initial idea influenced the way you\u2019ve developed this hypothesis, and what steps could you take to ensure greater objectivity?",
  "If you had to completely start over without any preconceptions, how might you reformulate your hypothesis?",
  "Can you describe a scenario in which your initial hypothesis could lead to misleading conclusions, and how would you guard against this?",
  "Goal: Encourage reflection on the hypothesis from different perspectives.",
  "What do you consider to be the weakest points of your hypothesis, and what steps could you take to address them?",
  "If you presented this hypothesis at a conference, what specific questions or criticisms would you anticipate, and how would you respond?",
  "How would you respond to someone who doubts the validity or feasibility of your hypothesis, and what evidence or reasoning would you use to persuade them?"
